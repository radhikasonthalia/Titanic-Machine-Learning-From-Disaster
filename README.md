# Titanic-Machine-Learning-From-Disaster

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we have built a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

# Techniques Used:
1. Imputation Methods to impute NaN values
2. Exploring Information about Cabin Placement on the Titanic to create new Features
3. Extensive EDA to understand relationships in the Data
4. Feature Engineering to Create New Features and Make Existing Features More Useful
5. Logistic Regression,Naive Bayes,Random Forest,Decision Tree and SVM Classifiers
6. K-Fold Cross Validation
